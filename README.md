# Mathematica-ClassDef
A Mathematica module that lets you define very basic classes with member functions and data

## Getting Started

Put the file `ClassDef.m` somewhere where mathematica can find it.

Import the ClassDef module using
```
Needs["ClassDef`"]
```
Then you can define basic classes with data members and member functions.

The package includes an example of defining a class, `Date.m`, and an example of using it, `Date_example.m`
